# Pub-Subs-Implementation

code as a story -

In a bustling digital city, there's a legendary information broker known as *Mr. Singleton*. He's unique because there's only one of him in the entire city; anyone who needs him must go to his single, central office. This is his first rule: **there is only one instance of me**.

His office holds a special, high-speed teletype machine—his redisClient—connected directly to the city's Central News Wire (Redis). He also keeps a meticulous ledger, his subscriptions book.

One day, a client named Alice (userId: "alice") walks in.

"Mr. Singleton," she says, "I'm interested in everything happening with 'Tesla Motors' (stock: "TSLA"). Please keep me updated."

Mr. Singleton opens his ledger. He sees there's no page for "TSLA" yet. This is a new request! So, he does two things:

1.  He flips to a new page in his ledger, writes "TSLA" at the top, and adds Alice's name underneath.
2.  He turns to his teletype machine and sends a special message to the Central News Wire: "**subscribe to the 'TSLA' channel." From now on, any news about TSLA will be instantly sent to his machine.

A little later, another client, Bob, comes in with the same request. "I'd like news on 'TSLA', please."

Mr. Singleton smiles. He simply flips to the "TSLA" page in his ledger and adds Bob's name under Alice's. He's efficient—he doesn't need to contact the News Wire again, as the 'TSLA' news feed is already active.

Suddenly, the teletype machine buzzes to life. A message clatters out: Message received on channel TSLA: Stock price up 5%.

Mr. Singleton immediately springs into action (handleMessage). He flips open his ledger to the "TSLA" page, sees the names "Alice" and "Bob," and instantly dispatches a messenger to each of them with the news.

After a few weeks, Alice decides she's no longer interested. She visits the office again. "Mr. Singleton, please unsubscribe me from 'TSLA' news."

He nods, takes out his pen, and neatly crosses Alice's name off the "TSLA" page. He sees Bob's name is still there, so he keeps the teletype connection to the 'TSLA' channel open for him.

Finally, Bob also decides to unsubscribe. When Mr. Singleton crosses Bob's name out, he notices the "TSLA" page is now completely empty.

"No one is interested in this anymore," he thinks. To save energy and avoid clutter, he sends one last message to the Central News Wire: "**unsubscribe from the 'TSLA' channel." The feed goes silent.

And so, Mr. Singleton continues his work, masterfully managing the flow of information, ensuring news is only requested when needed and delivered only to those who ask for it, all from his single, indispensable office.
